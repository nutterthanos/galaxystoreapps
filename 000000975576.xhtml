What if they are actually playing a game together? Wouldn’t that actually be a delightful scene? &#xd;
That is because playing games with your friends is awesome! &#xd;
There is an app that lets people share and play content, such as games, with nearby friends in real time: not just ‘share’, but ‘play’ as well. &#xd;
This game friendly app is called Group Play and here are some gamer-friendly facts about it. &#xd;
&#xd;
- Group Play can combine or separate perspectives &#xd;
Warning! This function has never been attempted by anyone. Group Play allows devices to combine and enlarge the screen or divide into separate perspectives. &#xd;
Most importantly, it is only available Group Play. This will sound pretty cool, because it will add a lot of character into your game and provide a unique experience to gamers. &#xd;
&#xd;
- Group Play can utilize Gyroscope Sensor &#xd;
Game players can move their mobile devices around their surroundings to scan around the virtual world in the game, as if they are standing at the center of world that game provides. &#xd;
This is possible because this Group Play gaming app can utilize the gyroscope (or gyro) sensor that senses additional dimensions whenever you rotate or move your mobile device around, so you can stay oriented during the intense battle. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
- Play your favorite videos with your friends &#xd;
Now you can play videos not only on your device but also on your friends' devices. You can share the videos on a single screen or &#xd;
split the video between multiple screens (Multi Vision) &#xd;
(※ Multi Vision cannot be available on certain devices) &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
- Enjoy surround sound system with multi devices &#xd;
&#xd;
Get your friends together and let them enjoy your music simultaneously. &#xd;
Get all Samsung smart devices together and create a powerful sound system that enhances the sound quality and keeps the party going. &#xd;
- Simply pairing multiple Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablet</contentDescription><contentNewDescription/><cnvrnImgUrl>/product/000000975576/IconImage_20160425032517190_NEW_WEB_ICON.png</cnvrnImgUrl><youtubeUrl/><youtubeImgUrl/><itemGroupId/><itemPurchaseFlag>N</itemPurchaseFlag><prepostFlag>Y</prepostFlag><sellerName>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</sellerName><copyrightHolder>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</copyrightHolder><sellerId/><iconURL>https://img.samsungapps.com/product/000000975576/IconImage_20160425032517190_NEW_WAP_ICON_512_512.png</iconURL><localPrice>$0.00</localPrice><discountPrice/><discountFlag>N</discountFlag><freeFlag>Y</freeFlag><ctntLanguageCode>DFT</ctntLanguageCode><limitAgeCd>0</limitAgeCd><limitAgeDetail/><contentGradeImageUrl/><ratingValue>stars rating-stars-3-5</ratingValue><ratingNumber>3.5</ratingNumber><commentListTotalCount/><contentBinaryVersion>3.0.262</contentBinaryVersion><contentBinarySize>28.68 MB</contentBinarySize><customerSupportEmail/><sellerPrivatePolicy/><sellerSite/><commentTitle/><editorComment/><countryCode>AUS</countryCode><locale>en</locale><modifyDate>2016.04.26</modifyDate><generalCategoryId/><generalCategoryName/><categoryPath/><deeplinkUrl>samsungapps://ProductDetail/com.samsung.groupcast?session_id=W_28D96360094AF0BF383CD90078BDD137&amp;gsw_source=GSWebToDetail</deeplinkUrl><managerlinkUrl/><permissionList><permissionList>phone</permissionList><permissionList>sms</permissionList><permissionList>location</permissionList><permissionList>storage</permissionList><permissionList>microphone</permissionList><permissionList>contacts</permissionList></permissionList><screenshotRes>480x800|480x800|480x800|480x800</screenshotRes><contentBinaryWatchType>N</contentBinaryWatchType></DetailMain><page_meta_desc>Whenever you see a group of people sitting around a table each staring at their mobile devices, do you think of a meme with text that says “end of the world”. &#xd;
