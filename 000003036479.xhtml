 With Bixby, getting things done has never been easier. Bixby knows your phone’s apps and how to use them. Plus, you can talk, tap or type, because Bixby understands it all. 

•Talk to Bixby 
 You can talk to Bixby by pressing the Bixby key or pressing and holding it. 
 For example, press the key and say “What time is it?” If you wait a little or press the key again, Bixby will get to work. You can also press and hold the Bixby key. Bixby will listen to you while you're holding the key. When you release the key after you've finished speaking, Bixby will get to work. 

•Wake Bixby with your voice 
 You can call Bixby without touching your phone. Register your voice so Bixby responds whenever you say “Bixby” or give a command like “Bixby, show me today's weather.” 

•Use dictation 
 Speak instead of typing. It's a handy way to take notes and write messages. 
 On the screen you want to fill in, press the Bixby key and say “Write down.” to show Bixby dictation mode. Once it's shown, press the Bixby key, tap the Bixby icon, or say “Bixby” to begin dictating. Bixby will type what you say. 

 
To close dictation mode, stop speaking and wait a moment, or say “Stop writing” •Use face recognition 
 Face recognition is the fastest way to unlock your phone and access Bixby. You can register your face in Settings. 

•Include app name in commands 
 Bixby can understand you better if you include the app name when you give a command, like “%s.”' 

•Answer and continue 
 Don't worry about saying everything perfectly. Bixby will ask follow-up questions if more detail is needed. 
 When Bixby asks you a question, press the Bixby key to answer or select your answer directly on the screen, then tap Continue. 

•Use hints 
 If you're not sure what to say to Bixby, don't sweat it. Bixby will provide suggestions based on the app you're using right now. Tap a hint or say it out loud. 
 You'll see even more suggestions when you go to the full-screen view of Bixby Voice. 

•Talk or type 
 You can use Bixby even when you can't speak out loud. 
 When it's not convenient to talk to Bixby, you can tell Bixby what to do by typing. Tap the keyboard button on the Bixby full view. 

•Give Feedback 
 How's Bixby doing? 
 If Bixby's not understanding you as well as you'd like, let Bixby know by tapping the thumbs down icon. If you think Bixby's doing a good job at understanding you, tap the thumbs up icon. Your feedback helps Bixby get smarter.
