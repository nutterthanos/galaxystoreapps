□ Find family members and friends and share your location in the “People” tab
Share your location with family members and friends using the Samsung Find app. With your friends using the Samsung Find app, share and see each other’s locations for a set period of time, such as an hour or a day.
With the Samsung Find app, if “Share My Location” is turned on, you can share your location with people from contacts on your Galaxy phone, tablet, or Galaxy Watch as well as your friends and family members, or ask them to share their location with you.

□ Find your devices or family members’ devices in the “Devices” tab
Find your own devices or a family member’s devices using the Samsung Find app.
Easily find your lost Galaxy phone, tablet, Watch, Buds, or other devices with Samsung Find. Identify your device’s location on the map, or use a navigation app to get directions to such a location on the map. If the exact location can’t be identified, if your device supports the “Make Sound” feature, you can use it to help find devices that are nearby.
If you lose your phone and find yourself in a situation in which you can’t use the Samsung Find app, find your device through the Samsung Find app of a family member who you’ve already shared your device with, or find your device directly by logging into samsungfind.samsung.com using a web browser.

□ Track personal items in the “Items” tab
See SmartTags registered by SmartThings as well as various compatible third-party Trackers in the Items tab of the Samsung Find app. Register SmartTags directly on the Samsung Find app to not only see the locations of personal items you want to keep track of, but also track the locations of pets, bikes, and other things that you want to share with family members and friends. By setting the “Offline Finding” feature for your devices registered with Samsung Find, nearby devices can detect your SmartTag using secure Bluetooth technology and let you know the approximate location of the item with the SmartTag attached.

[Usage Environment]
Can be used on devices running Q OS or higher.
