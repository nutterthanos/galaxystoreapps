∙ Talk to Bixby
 Press and hold the Bixby key, then tell Bixby what you want to do: “What time is it now?”
Bixby will listen to you while you're holding the key. When you release the key after you've finished speaking, Bixby will get to work.
 Once you're talking to Bixby, you don't have to repeat “Hi Bixby” each time you say something new.

∙ Wake Bixby with your voice
 You can call Bixby without touching your phone. Register your voice so Bixby responds whenever you say “Hi Bixby” or give a command like “Hi Bixby, How is the weather today?”

∙ Use hints
 If you're not sure what to say to Bixby, don't sweat it. Bixby will provide suggestions based on the app you're using right now. Tap a hint or say it out loud.
 You'll see even more suggestions when you go to the full-screen view of Bixby Voice.

∙ Talk or type
 You can use Bixby even when you can't speak out loud.
 When it's not convenient to talk to Bixby, you can tell Bixby what to do by typing, or get suggested commands by tapping SEARCH FOR HINTS in Bixby full view.

∙ Quick commands
 Add your own quick commands for frequently used commands. For example, you could replace “Reject that call with a text that says Sorry I’m driving. I’ll get back to you soon” with “I'm driving”. If you add this quick command and say “I'm driving”, Bixby will respond as if you'd said the full command.
 You can add quick commands on the Bixby History screen or from the My Bixby menu.</contentDescription><contentNewDescription>. Hands Eyes Free Improvement - User will hear more detailed descriptions in hands-eyes free situations including BT headset usage.
