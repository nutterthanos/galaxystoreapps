 HOW IT WORKS
 With data saving modes or privacy modes activated, all your network traffic from your apps is compressed and encrypted by Samsung Max’s servers before it reaches your Android device. A bank-grade, secure network connection means even when you are on public Wi-Fi your personal information is protected, and Max’s data savings cloud means the data usage is as efficient as possible. 

 PREMIUM MODE 
 To support the most advanced and FREE data savings service, and the powerful Secure Wi-Fi and Privacy protection service, Samsung Max shows ads to keep the services free. 

 There is an option to control your ad experience. You can choose to view ads inside the app or enable premium mode, which grants you access to powerful app management features and unlimited usage of savings and privacy services. In exchange, it shows you ads in the Samsung lock screen ONLY while your device is plugged in charging. Choose how you want to experience ads, and enjoy the powerful and free data savings and privacy protection services from Samsung.
